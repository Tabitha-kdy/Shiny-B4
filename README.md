Welcome to Tabitha's repository for Assignment B4 of STAT 545B!

For this Assignment, **Option C - Shiny App (creating an entirely new app)** was selected.

You can visit the **Vancouver Cherry Blossoms Shiny app** here.(insert link)

**App Description:**

This app was designed for a hypothetical client named Julia, who is looking for an apartment in Toronto for herself and her pet dog Finnegan. Julia would like to know how many elevators would be in her apartment building, as her dog Finnegan is older and cannot climb up many flights of stairs. Julia would also like to see which apartments are pet-friendly, along with the year built, as she has a preference for newer buildings. Julia would like to have this information displayed for each unique Ward in Toronto, so she can decide where to direct her apartment-hunting efforts.

**App Datasource:**

This Shiny app used the **apt_buildings** dataset provided within the [**R Package datateachr**](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr).
