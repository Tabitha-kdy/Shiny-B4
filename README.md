Welcome to Tabitha's repository for Assignment B4 of STAT 545B!

For this Assignment, **Option C - Shiny App (creating an entirely new app)** was selected.

You can visit the **Vancouver Cherry Blossoms Shiny app** here.(insert link)


# App Description:

This app was designed to help tourists and locals find information on cherry blossoms in Vancouver. Cherry blossom viewing is an extrordinarily popular activity during the Spring months, and is often associated with exciting festivals, food, and photography. Using the Vancouver Cherry Blossoms Shiny app, users can filter by date planted using the Slider widget, and by cherry tree species using the Check Box widget. Their filters are applied to both the *Cherry Trees Data* tab, and the *Info Table* tab.

The **Cherry Trees Data** tab displays information on the distribution of cherry trees within 22 neighborhoods in Vancouver. 

The **Info Table** tab displays additional information on cherry trees in Vancouver, allowing users to view data on individual tree ID's, street name, block number, and side of street to aid in locating trees based on the filters selected.


# App Datasource:

This Shiny app used the **apt_buildings** dataset provided within the [**R Package datateachr**](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr).
